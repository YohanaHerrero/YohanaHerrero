- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Yohana Herrero, a last year PhD candidate at the Leibniz-Institut fÃ¼r Astrophysik Potsdam (AIP) in Prof. Dr. Lutz Wisotzkiâ€™s group (observational extragalactic astrophysics).
- My daily work consists on the analysis and treatment of large data samples (with python), finding correlations based on statistical approaches and self-coded algorithms, drawing conclusions that bring light into the current problems, method and tool development. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in astrophysics, data analysis/science, statistics, coding, tool development, etc
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently digging into the machine learning world, improving my statistics knowledge and GUI development skills.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via email: yherreroalonso@aip.de
